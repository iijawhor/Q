Yes — definitely. ✅

Adding a **README.md** is considered **best practice** for any project, even in early stages. It helps:

1. **Document the project purpose** — anyone (including future you) can quickly understand what the app is about.
2. **List setup instructions** — how to install, run, and build the project.
3. **Outline tech stack & features** — React, Vite, Tailwind, Redux, Router, etc.
4. **Make it GitHub-friendly** — gives your repo a professional look and improves collaboration.
